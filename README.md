# MMA API
This is an easily accessible API for MMA fight and fighter information. It is
built with Django and Django REST Framework. The data is kept up to date with
several scraping tools using Beautiful Soup.

You can check out the live site at www.mmaapi.com. I am working on adding
more information and welcome any thoughts or suggestions. Feel free to open an
issue on this page or email me directly through the address on my profile.
