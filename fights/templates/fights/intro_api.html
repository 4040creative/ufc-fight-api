        Hello and welcome to MMAAPI, a REST API for Mixed Martial Arts data.
        If you aren't sure what that means, don't worry. An API is just a way
        for computer programs to communicate and share information. If you just
        want to see the data you can do so in your browser.

        <p><h3>Why make this?</h3></p>
        <p>As a huge fan of both MMA and sports analytics I have often wondered
            about things like "How well do fighters age?" and "Does a high
            finish rate predict future success?" After looking and being
            unable to find a good dataset to work with I decided to make my own
            and put an API on it so others can use it too.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a work in progress and I am actively adding more information.
            The database is updated daily and currently has all x fighters,
            x fights, and x events in UFC history. Going forward I would like
            to add more organizations and other interesting information such
            as betting lines for each fight.
        </p>

        <p><h3>How does it work?</h3></p>
        <p>
            The data is accessed through a typical REST format.
            curl http://www.mmaapi.com/fighter/ returns a json object
            containing a list of fighters along with their id numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            curl http://www.mmaapi.com/fighter/486/ returns a single fighter
            object with bio information and their past won and lost fights.
            Like so:
        </p>
        <p>
            xxx
        </p>

        <p>
            The /event/ and /fight/ endpoints can be used in the same manner.
            The code is hosted on Github at
        </p>
